# M4 Firmware Update

## 1 Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to update the SiWx91x firmware via Wi-Fi by downloading an image from a remote TCP server. The TCP server may be hosted on a local PC (as demonstrated in this example), or alternately on a cloud service such as Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure. The update process works as follows:

- The SiWx91x connects via Wi-Fi as a TCP client to a TCP update server
- The SiWx91x OTA application sends a firmware file request to the server
- The server responds with the firmware file
- The OTA application programs the M4 firmware into the SiWx91x flash memory and reboots

## 2 Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### 2.1 Hardware Requirements  

- PC or Mac.
- Linux PC or Cygwin on Windows (to build and run the TCP server source provided)
- Wi-Fi Access point with a connection to the internet

### 2.2 Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio IDE

  - Download the latest [Simplicity Studio IDE](https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio)
  - Follow the [Simplicity Studio user guide](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/1.1.0/ss-5-users-guide-getting-started/install-ss-5-and-software#install-ssv5) to install Simplicity Studio IDE
  - Installation of Build tools for Linux including the gcc compiler (or equivalent on PC or Mac)

  - If you don't have Linux, [Cygwin for Windows](https://www.cygwin.com/) may be used instead

### 2.3 Setup Diagram

![Figure: Setup Diagram for SoC mode M4 Firmware Update Example](resources/readme/setup_soc.png)

## 3 Project Environment

- Ensure the SiWx91x loaded with the latest firmware following the [Upgrade Si91x firmware](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/getting-started-with-soc-mode#upgrade-si-wx91x-connectivity-firmware)

### 3.1 Creating the project

- In the Simplicity Studio IDE, the SiWx91x SoC board will be detected under **Debug Adapters** pane as shown below.

    **![Soc Board detection](resources/readme/soc_board_detection.png)**

- Ensure the latest Gecko SDK along with the WiSeConnect3 extension is added to Simplicity Studio.

- Studio should detect your board. Your board will be shown here. Click on the board detected and go to **EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS** section.

- Filter for Wi-Fi examples from the Gecko SDK added. For this, check the *Wi-Fi* checkbox under **Wireless Technology**

### 3.2 Set up for application prints

#### 3.2.1 SoC mode

  You can use either of the below USB to UART converters for application prints.

1. Set up using USB to UART converter board.

   - Connect Tx (Pin-6) to P27 on WSTK
   - Connect GND (Pin 8 or 10) to GND on WSTK

    **![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_1.png)**

2. Set up using USB to UART converter cable.

   - Connect RX (Pin 5) of TTL convertor to P27 on WSTK
   - Connect GND (Pin1) of TTL convertor to GND on WSTK

    **![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_2.png)**

**Tera Term set up - SoC modes**

1. Open the Tera Term tool.

    - For SoC mode, choose the serial port to which USB to UART converter is connected and click on **OK**.

      **![UART - SoC](resources/readme/port_selection_soc.png)**

2. Navigate to the Setup â†’ Serial port and update the baud rate to **115200** and click on **OK**.

## 4 Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment.

### 4.1.1 In the Project explorer pane, expand the **config** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network

- **STA instance related parameters**

- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which the SiWx91x SoftAP's Wi-Fi network shall be advertised.

  ```c
  #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
  ```

- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

  ```c
  #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
  ```

- Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

### 4.1.2 TCP Configuration

```c
#define SERVER_PORT        5000             // TCP server port of the remote TCP server
#define SERVER_IP_ADDRESS  "192.168.0.100"  // Server IP address 
```

### 4.2 Build the application

- Build as M4 Firmware update Example

    **![Build as](resources/readme/build_m4_firmware_update.png)**

### 4.3 Run and Test the application

## Build and run the TCP Server

  1. Copy the TCP server application [firmware_update_tcp_server.c](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect-wifi-bt-sdk/tree/master/examples/featured/firmware_update/firmware_update_tcp_server.c) provided with the application source to a Linux PC connected to the Wi-Fi access point.
  2. Compile the application

> `user@linux:~$ gcc firmware_update_tcp_server.c` -o ota_server.bin

  3. Run the application providing the TCP port number (specified in the SiWx91x app) together with the firmware file and path

> `user@linux:~$ ./ota_server.bin 5000 wifi_access_point_isp.bin`

... where [wifi_access_point_isp.bin](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect-wifi-bt-sdk/tree/master/firmware) is the firmware image to be sent to SiWx91x.

## Running the Application

After making any custom configuration changes required, build the application.

- Once the build was successful, right click on project and click on Debug As->Silicon Labs ARM Program as shown in below image.

    ![debug_mode_soc](resources/readme/debug_soc.png)

When the application runs and connects to the TCP server, the firmware image transfer occurs in chunks. The app requests a firmware chunk, the server sends the chunk, the app requests the next chunk, the server sends the chunk, and so forth until the entire transfer completes. As the transfer proceeds, progress is printed to the serial console. On completion, the console prints 'reach end of file'.
