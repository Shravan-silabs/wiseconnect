# WiSeConnect™ 3 SDK

The Silicon Labs WiSeConnect™ software development kit (SDK) offers an application programming interface (API) for use with the SiWx91x™ chipset family for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity.

The WiSeConnect 3 (versions 3.0.0 and later) SDK is the next-generation API for Silicon Labs customers that replaces WiSeConnect 2 (versions earlier than 3.0.0) with modular design and organization of features into configurable components.
