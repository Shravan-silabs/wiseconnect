/*! @defgroup PERIPHERAL_REFERENCE Peripheral Reference
 *
 *   This section provides an overview of Peripheral modules.
 *
 *  - @ref CALENDAR
 *    Calendar RTC can be used to set or get the current RTC time and date.
 *  - @ref CONFIG-TIMER
 *    Configurable timers are used for counting clocks and events, capturing events on the GPIOs in input mode and outputting modulated signals.
 *  - @ref DMA
 *    DMA is an AHB based DMA Controller core that transfers data from a source peripheral or memory to a destination peripheral or memory over one or more AHB buses.
 *  - @ref SLEEPTIMER
 *    The Sleeptimer driver provides software timers, delays, timekeeping and date functionalities using a low-frequency real-time clock peripheral.
 *  - @ref IOSTREAM
 *    IO Stream is a platform module software that provides Input/Output functionalities by creating streams.
 *  - @ref GPIO
 *    GPIO peripheral can support set, clear, toggle, programmed as input/output, generates pin and group interrupts etc.
 *  - @ref GSPI
 *    GSPI provides an I/O interface to a wide variety of SPI compatible peripheral devices.
 *  - @ref I2C
 *    There are four I2C Master/Slave controllers - two in the MCU HP peripherals (I2C1, I2C2), one in the NWP/security subsystem and one in the MCU ULP subsystem (ULP_I2C).
 *  - @ref SIO
 *    Serial GPIO Peripheral supports regular GPIO and enhanced serial stream processing features for 16 GPIO pins.
 *  - @ref SSI
 *    There are three Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI) - one in the MCU HP peripherals (Master) and one in the MCU ULP subsystem (ULP Master) and one is MCU HP peripheral (Slave).
 *  - @ref ULP-TIMER
 *    ULP Timer is used in counting clocks, micro seconds, milli seconds, seconds and minutes with both ref clock and system (SoC) clock.
 *  - @ref USART
 *    Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter Peripheral API.
 *  - @ref WATCHDOG-TIMER
 *    WatchDog-timer is used generate an interrupt on timeout and a system-reset in case of system failure which can be caused by an external event like ESD pulse or due to a software failure.
